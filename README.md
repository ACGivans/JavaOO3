Photobooth.

The purpose of this program is to allow users to take and print a certain amount of photographs at the wedding they are attending. It first asks the user for the email of the bride so that the photos taken can be sent to her. Then it asks the maximum photos allowed to be taken. Then it asks for the max number of photos to be printed. Then it will ask for the title of the photo and wether or not the photo is to be printed. Then it asks for the participants email so that the photo can be sent to the participant in addition to the bride. The program will then display the number of photos allowed to be taken as well as the number of photos allowed printed. It will then ask to take a photo and afterwards display a report of photo details entered.
