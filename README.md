Photobooth.

The purpose of this program is to ask the user for the name of the family 
   hosting the wedding. It then allows the user to create as many family 
   invitation objects as the users wishes. Once the list has been created, a
   menu is presented to the user allowing them to either rescind invitations,
   choose the food options for each family member, or exit the program.
